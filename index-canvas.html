Assignment:

Latin for "Little Animal", the term "animalcule" was coined
by Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the 17th-century discoverer of microorganisms,
to describe the inhabitants of the strange new world he was
observing. In this exercise small microorganism-like entities are cloned
by clicking on their ancestors. Since we needed a test to put our 
candidates "under a microscope", we thought it would be poetic 
to make them create their own microscopic environment, as well as 
something small and simple that would tell us more about them
than a casual glance at the assignment would expect.

Possible Solution:
